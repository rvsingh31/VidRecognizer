# VidRecognizer

## Perform Video Classification and Action recognition on UCF101 Dataset

This project aims at classifying videos and perform activity recognition over the dataset provided by [UCF](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php). The dataset contains approximately 11K videos distributed as 101 actions.<br/>

The repository contains two directories: <br/>

1. archive: Contains jupyter notebooks, python files, datasets and pre-processing codes used during the project timeline. The directory is not well structured for understanding purpose. The sole purpose of this directory was to accommodate files during the development phase.

2. src: Contains well documented and well structured code for reference. 
<br/>

To give you an idea of the activity recognition, below is a video in which a predicted action is embedded along with model's confidence level. The prediction is made using C3D model. You can read more over [here](src/README.md).
